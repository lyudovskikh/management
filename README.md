# Task

 We want you to build a new user management service. The service must offer CRUD operations
 for the users. The users must be unique, they should have basic information and their first, last
 name must not exceed 100 characters.
 
 In order to achieve this, we want you to build a new service that exposes an API with the
 following specifications:
 
 1) Creates new user    
    a. The API should accept only valid data
 2) Returns all the users
 3) Returns a user by ID
 4) Deletes a user
 5) Updates a users data
 
 ## Acceptance Criteria
 
 ### Scenario: Create valid user
 Given I am a user
 
 When I submit valid data for a new user
 
 Then the user is created
 
 ### Scenario: Retrieve User
 
 Given I am a user
 
 When I request to retrieve a user by Id
 
 Then I can see the userâ€™s basic information
 
 ### Scenario: Retrieve all users
 
 Given I am a user
 
 When I request to retrieve all users
 
 Then I can see all the users
 
 And when I filter by first name
 
 Then I retrieve only the users having a similar first name
 
 
 ### Scenario: Delete User
 
 Given I am a user
 
 When I request to delete a user by Id
 
 Then the user is deleted
